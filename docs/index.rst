Welcome to ml_engine's documentation!
===============================
This is an open-source program for creating machine learning programs. The procedures ml-engine employes are computationally intensive as the program will not only identify the ideal engine to use, but will also iterate over many architectures and hyperparameters so as to increase the probability of optimal convergence. 


Installation
==================
The current stable version can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ml_engine
